# Better Twitch VOD Browser

Live [here](https://btvb.mewtant.uk)

An easier way to browse Twitch VODs, allowing you to browse a range of time periods, and with more options for sorting. You can sign in with Twitch to display all recent VODs from people you follow, making it easier to browse any recent streams you may have missed.

## Why
For some reason, Twitch only allows you to view "Trending" VODs when browsing by game. This means that Twitch only shows you VODs from up to a week ago, and sorted by whatever "Trending" is. 

This app searches all Twitch VODs (providing they are still available on Twitch), rather than just last weeks.

Being able to view all recent VODs from streamers you follow also seemed like a useful feature that Twitch is apparently missing, so you can do that too if you login.
